            <p>Tony Stark is a wealthy industrialist, genius inventor, and playboy. He inherits Stark Industries, a
                leading defense contractor, from his father, Howard Stark.<br><br>
                Stark's life takes a dramatic turn when he is captured by terrorists during a weapons demonstration in a
                war zone. Seriously injured by shrapnel lodged near his heart, he is forced to build a weapon for his
                captors. Instead, he creates a suit of powered armor to escape, which also keeps him alive by preventing
                the shrapnel from reaching his heart.<br><br>This experience leads Stark to reevaluate his life and the
                impact of his inventions, prompting him to become the armored superhero, Iron Man.</p>

            <p>Alright, let’s talk Iron Man armors. I’ve built a few in my time. Each one is a testament to what happens
                when you mix genius, determination, and a little bit of flair for the dramatic. Let’s start from the
                top. <br> <br>

            <h3>Mark I</h3>
            Ah, the Mark I. The birthplace of Iron Man. Built it in a cave with a box of scraps. No, seriously. It was
            clunky, ugly, and about as high-tech as a toaster, but it got the job done. It got me out alive. That’s all
            that mattered.<br> <br>

            <h3>Mark II</h3>
            Next up, the Mark II. Sleeker, more refined. It was my first real attempt at taking the Iron Man concept to
            the next level. Added flight capabilities, but had a little issue with icing. You live, you learn.<br> <br>

            <h3>Mark III</h3>
            Then came the Mark III. The first suit to sport the now iconic red and gold. Solved the icing problem with
            some gold-titanium alloy. Added a few more toys, like repulsors and rockets. This was the suit that really
            made me feel like Iron Man.
