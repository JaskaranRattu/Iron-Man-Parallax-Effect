            <p>Tony Stark is a wealthy industrialist, genius inventor, and playboy. He inherits Stark Industries, a
                leading defense contractor, from his father, Howard Stark.<br><br>
                Stark's life takes a dramatic turn when he is captured by terrorists during a weapons demonstration in a
                war zone. Seriously injured by shrapnel lodged near his heart, he is forced to build a weapon for his
                captors. Instead, he creates a suit of powered armor to escape, which also keeps him alive by preventing
                the shrapnel from reaching his heart.<br><br>This experience leads Stark to reevaluate his life and the
                impact of his inventions, prompting him to become the armored superhero, Iron Man.</p>

            <p>I'm Tony Stark. You might know me as Iron Man, the genius billionaire playboy philanthropist.<br><br>I've built and sold more technological marvels than anyone else on the planet, but don't let the flashy suits and cutting-edge tech fool you - at the core, I'm just a guy trying to save the world one invention at a time. Whether it's leading Stark Industries to the top of the tech world, crafting revolutionary suits of armor, or working alongside the Avengers to fend off intergalactic threats, I strive to push the boundaries of what's possible.<br><br>Sure, I have my flaws, but who doesn't? At the end of the day, it's all about using my talents and resources to make a difference. So, here's to the future, where innovation and heroism go hand in hand.</p>
